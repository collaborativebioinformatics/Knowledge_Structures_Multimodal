    "The server implements these main steps:\n",
    "1. FL server initializes an initial model.\n",
    "2. For each round (global iteration):\n",
    "    - FL server samples available clients.\n",
    "    - FL server sends the global model to clients and waits for their updates.\n",
    "    - FL server aggregates all the `results` and produces a new global model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will directly use the default federated averaging algorithm provided by NVFlare utilizing the [FedAvgRecipe](https://nvflare.readthedocs.io/en/main/apidocs/nvflare.app_opt.pt.recipes.fedavg.html#nvflare.app_opt.pt.recipes.fedavg.FedAvgRecipe) for PyTorch. \n",
